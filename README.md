# Demo

Learning github and github repositories. I hope to learn better this time.

I'm trying to add few points to this file to test git status

creating SSH key to push the files to github from local system
 
 So far I have leart to create SSH keys and add the public key to my github account.

 I was able to authenticate and connect to my github account.

 I'm now making changes in my file and pushing it to the github account.

 "git add ." - add all the changes.
 "git commit -m "its more likely a message about what changes i made""
 "git push origin main" - pushing the changes online
